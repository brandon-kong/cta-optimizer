# CTA Optimizer

This is a software that optimizes the route of any general public transportation system. It uses a genetic algorithm to find the best route for a given set of parameters.

I intended to use the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) as the public transportation system to optimize, but the software is general enough to be used with any other public transportation system.
